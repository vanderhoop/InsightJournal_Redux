###InsightJournal_Redux
---

InsightJournal is an online journaling tool that provides users with instant content and sentiment analysis of their entries, alerting users to trends in their writing. It's awesome.

###The Story Behind 'Redux'
---
I built InsightJournal once before, when I had only an infant's understanding of Rails, and naturally the project didn't turn out the way I hoped. (The original GitHub repo is available for scrutiny [here](https://github.com/vanderhoop/ThoughtLog).)

Now that I have more experience and tools at my disposal, I'm giving my baby the attention it deserves. I hope you like it.

###Top Level User Stories
---
As a passionate journaler,
I want to glean insights from my journal entries,
so that I can act on those insights.
